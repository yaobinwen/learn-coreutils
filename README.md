# Learn `coreutils`

## Overview

This repository contains the versions of [coreutils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/coreutils) source files that I'm interested in and the notes I made for learning purpose. Because I mainly work on Ubuntu, the source code all comes from the `coreutils` package on Launchpad. Therefore, the code in this repository belongs to the original authors and should be used under the same license. See [their license on Launchpad](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/coreutils/tree/COPYING).

Each version is in its own sub-folder. My notes are all marked with `NOTE(ywen)`. The log messages I added are prefixed with `[ywen]`.

## Versions

- `8.28-1ubuntu1`: This version is used on Ubuntu 18.04 (with patches applied). Corresponding tag: [applied/8.28-1ubuntu1](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/coreutils/tree/?h=applied/8.28-1ubuntu1)
